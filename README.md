- **Backend:** Built with Express.js, providing RESTful APIs for CRUD operations.
- **Database:** MongoDB used for secure storage of passwords.
- **Functionality:** Users can save, edit, and delete passwords through an intuitive user interface.

### Motivation

The main motivation behind this project was educational. It aimed to enhance skills in:
- Full stack development
- Frontend-backend interaction
- API development and integration
- Secure data management with MongoDB

### Getting Started
